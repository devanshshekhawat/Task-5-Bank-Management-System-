# Task-5-Bank-Management-System-

Hey Everyone! This project simulates a basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
It allows users to perform common banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and viewing transaction history — all through a simple console interface.

Features

1. Account Management — Create an account with a unique account number and holder name.
2. Deposit & Withdraw — Add or withdraw money with balance validation.
3. Transaction History — Maintains a detailed list of all deposits and withdrawals.
4. Balance Inquiry — Instantly check your current balance.
5. Interactive Menu — Console-based menu for continuous operations until exit.

Technologies Used

Language: Java
Concepts: OOP (Encapsulation, Classes, Objects, Methods)
Data Structures: ArrayList for transaction history
IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

How It Works

* The user creates an account with an initial balance.
* The system presents a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, or view account details.
* Each transaction is recorded in the transaction history for transparency.
* The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
